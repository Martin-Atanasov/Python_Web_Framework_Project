# Python_Web_Framework_Project
 Final Project of the course

BabyBook is a place where you can save and share your precious baby memories.
BabyBook makes it easy to keep track of all the fun stories and memories you share in your baby's first year, plus you can share it with the fam!
Are you sentimental and want to remember your child’s early years? Do you want to preserve these precious memories for when they’re older? You’re on the right place!
Share with your little one what the world was like when they were born. All those precious moments are backed up and kept private for you to share with those you choose.

Babybook is created on Django/Python/.
You can create user, sign in, sign out.
Upon registration you have default profile picture/anonymous/ which you can change it later.
